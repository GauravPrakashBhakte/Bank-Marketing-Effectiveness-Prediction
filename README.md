# Bank-Marketing-Effectiveness-Prediction
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).
Discussion of Portugal Bank Institution Dataset will involve various steps such as:

• Loading the data into data frame
• Data Description
• Exploratory Analysis and Visualizations
• Model Implementation
• Decision Tree
• KNN
• XGBoost
• Conclusion


That's how we have accomplished our team work in Bank Marketing Effectiveness Prediction
Project.Throughout the project we learn many new things right from takingproblem statement to understand
the technical side of a data to analysis. We deal
with Portugal Banking institution data.
• The model helps to target the right customer rather than wasting time on wrong customer
• Comparing to all algorithms XGboost algorithm has best accuracy score and ROC-AUC score
. So it is concluded as optimal model.
• The model can help to classify the customers on the basis on which they deposit or not.
